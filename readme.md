Monkey Chatter
==============

This is an attempt to work through the book 
'[Writing an interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)' by Thorsten Ball,
but I'll be writing Javascript code instead of retyping Golang examples from the text. 
The toy language in the book is called 'Monkey'.

Running tests
-------------

`npm test`
